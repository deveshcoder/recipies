All-purpose flour: Bleached or unbleached flour works here. Unbleached spreads just a little less and produces softer cookies while unbleached flour makes slightly chewier cookies.
Cocoa powder: Don’t use dutch process cocoa powder, it’s too dark here.
Baking soda: If you want cookies a little puffier include 1/4 tsp baking powder along with the baking soda.
Salt: Just use table salt.
Unsalted butter: If you only have salted butter on hand you can use that here. Just add 1/8 tsp salt to the recipe.
Granulated sugar and brown sugar: The combo makes the cookies perfectly sweet and the brown sugar helps make the cookies softer.
Egg: This helps bind the ingredients and also makes for a softer cookie.
Red food coloring: I have made these with both gel and liquid food coloring. Gel seems to work just a little better since it’s not as liquidy but it is harder to find at most grocery stores so I’ve included options for both. You can try beet powder or a natural gel color but keep in mind the color won’t be as vibrant.
Vanilla extract: Another option here is to use vanilla bean paste.
Vinegar: Just plain white vinegar is used here (similar to classic red velvet cake) but I’ve also used lemon juice and it works well too. It just boosts flavor a little.
White chocolate chips: I like the pretty contrast of the white chocolate chips but semi-sweet or even milk chocolate chips will work well too for richer chocolate flavor.
